Options:
-d\tRun usb-scanner in the background as a daemon
-h\tShow this help dialogue and exit
-v\tPrint current version and exit
-f\tForce Keyboard mapping with any connected Xbox Controller recognized

To add support (keep in may this may not work for all controllers)
run 'lsusb' with your controller hooked up, determine which line
that gets printed out is about your controller, and copy-paste the
8-digit code with a colon (:) in the middle (including the colon)
into the file $cache/custom_add.list"
